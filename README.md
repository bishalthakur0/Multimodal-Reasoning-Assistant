# Multimodal Reasoning Assistant

## 1. Overview
The Multimodal Reasoning Assistant is an AI-powered system designed to answer complex queries by reasoning over text and image inputs simultaneously. The assistant leverages CLIP embeddings for image understanding and integrates them with a Large Language Model (LLaMA or Qwen) for unified reasoning. It is extended into an agentic framework, where the assistant can perform actions (e.g., fetch information, verify facts) with safety fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.

This project demonstrates expertise in multimodal AI, LLMs, reinforcement learning, and agentic safety—core focus areas of Microsoft Research India’s Research Fellow program.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
### Primary Goals
*   Enable multimodal reasoning: Answer questions using both text + image context.
*   Integrate chain-of-thought reasoning to improve logical accuracy.
*   Provide safe and reliable outputs with fallback strategies.

### Secondary Goals
*   Experiment with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for improving multimodal response quality.
*   Create an extensible agent framework that can integrate additional modalities (e.g., audio, video).

## 3. Key Features
### Multimodal Input Support
*   Accepts text + image queries (e.g., “What is happening in this picture, and how does it relate to climate change?”).
*   Uses CLIP to extract image embeddings and align with text embeddings.

### Unified Reasoning Engine
*   LLaMA/Qwen fine-tuned for multimodal reasoning tasks.
*   Implements prompt engineering + chain-of-thought reasoning for structured responses.

### Agentic Extension
*   Ability to invoke tools (e.g., web search, knowledge base) when needed.
*   Agentic safety layer: Ensures safe responses with fallback to baseline LLM output in case of uncertainty.

### Evaluation & Metrics
*   Accuracy measured on VQA (Visual Question Answering) datasets.
*   Track safety compliance rate and hallucination reduction.

## 4. System Architecture
### High-Level Flow:
```
[User Query: Text + Image ]
        ↓
[Image Encoder: CLIP → Image Embeddings ]
        ↓
[Text Encoder + Fusion Layer → Unified Embeddings ]
        ↓
[LLM (LLaMA/Qwen) → Reasoning Engine ]
        ↓
[Agentic Safety Layer → Fact-check / Fallback ]
        ↓
[Final Response to User ]
```

### Components:
